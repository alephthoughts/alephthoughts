    "text": "Welcome to my blog!\nThis is the medium I will use to share my thoughts on many things that I find interesting. I have a buzzing mind which makes it hard for me to focus on one thing at a time. So I decided to name this blog after something that describes the state of my mind. How many thoughts at once do I have in my head?, I asked myself. My mind drifted to another question, What is the biggest number? It turns out the largest number is a geoglyph, “40” made of trees in Russia covering an area of 12000 square meters. 40Thoughts didn’t sound cool enough to me, so my search continued. A GoogolThoughts or GoogolplexThoughts are big cardinal numbers but I wanted something bigger. So I named this blog after the smallest infinity which is denoted by the first Hebrew letter “Aleph”.\nThis place is going to be about stuff I find cool and numbers top that list. Another thing that is really cool is programming. I really love python for its easy of use and amazing community. Swift is another language that I find really interesting. I love reading about everything related to science and can spend hours discussing philosophy and politics. The common theme around all these things is my vision for a better world. I am by no means a good writer but still I would love to put my thoughts on things out there and love to read yours. So hope so see you on my blog.\nCheers!!"

If you’re someone who knows pandas and want to learn SQL or you know SQL and want to learn pandas, this post will introduce you to some basic skills.\nTo work on SQL you need access to a database hosted locally or on the cloud. Some popular databases you can work with are the following:\nThere are many more but I’ve tried to list down the popular ones. To show side by side examples, however, I am not using any database. I have using a SQL engine called pandasql. So to run these examples, you will have to read some data into pandas dataframe and then use pandasql to run SQL queries.\nSo the steps are as follows:"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The first paper I chose to write about is one of the most famous papers in the Deep Learning community titled, Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks by M. Zeiler, R. Fergus. Appeared in 2013 this paper remains popular as it introduced some of the most fundamental ideas to aid our understanding of convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. Convolutional neural networks have performed exceedingly well over time on image related tasks. The main objective of this paper is enquire about :-\nThe most important ideas introduced in this paper are the following:\nBefore looking into these ideas in a little detail, let’s first discuss the convnet model architecture studied and used in this paper. The standard operation of a convnet is to map colored two dimensional images to a probability vector over different classes i.e. it takes an image as input and returns a vector of probabilities(adding to 1) of the image belonging to each of the classes. Each layer of the convenet consists of:\nThe top few layers of the convnet are the fully-connected layers follwed by a softmax classifier at the end.\nNow let’s look at the important ideas discussed in this paper:"

    "section": "Visualizing convolutional networks with Deconvnet",
    "text": "Visualizing convolutional networks with Deconvnet\nThe process of visualizing a convnet involves identifying the cause of each activation by mapping the activations back to input pixel space with the aid of a Deconvolutional Network (deconvnet). A deconvnet can be thought of as a convnet but in reverse. It is attached to each of the convnet layers in order to probe the activations. In order to examine a given activation, all other activations in the conenet layer are set to zero and the feature maps are passed to the attached deconvnet layer. Then following operations are performed repeatedly until input pixel space is reconstructed:\n\nUnpooling : Since max pooling operation is non-invertible, an approximate inverse is obtained by restoring the activations at the locations of maximum activation selection.\nRectification : The reconstructed signals are passed through a relu non-linearity.\nFiltering : In the deconvnet each convnet filter is transposed (flipped vertically and horizontally) and applied to the rectified activations. \n\n\nConvnet Visualization\nThe aforementioned approach is used to visualize the top 9 strongest activations for a given feature map. These activations are projected to pixel space and shown alongside corresponding image patches. Let’s see each layer one by one:\n\nLayer 2:\nLayer 2 corresponds to corners and other edge/color conjuctions. \n\n\nLayer 3:\nLayer 3 captures complex patterns such as mesh patterns, texts etc. \n\n\nLayer 4:\nLayer 4 shows further variations and is able to classify objects in the picture such as dog faces, bird legs etc. \n\n\nLayer 5:\nLayer 5 shows complete objects such as keyboards, dogs etc. \n\n\n\nKey Insights\n\nThe lower layers of the model converge within few epochs and upper layers fully converge only after a considerable number of epochs. This suggests it might be beneficial to train different layers at different learning rates.\nBy systematically occluding different portions of the image with a grey square and monitoring the output of the classifier, it was observed that the model was able to localize the objects in the scene (explainabilty).\nOverall depth of the model is important for obtaining good performance. Changing the size of the fully connected layers makes little difference to perfor- mance. However, increasing the size of the middle convolution layers give a useful gain in performance. But in- creasing these, while also enlarging the fully connected layers results in overfitting.\nKeeping intial layers trained on ImageNet fixed and training a new softmax classifier of appropriate size using training images from Caltech-256, Caltech-101, PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets resulted in faster training and better results.

    "text": "India is well-known for its cultural, linguistic, racial, and geographical variety. It has one of the world’s fastest-growing economies and is a force to be reckoned with. Nonetheless, the western media and the western world have a perception of the country that persists to this day in their news, movies, and media coverage. This bias creeps into the data sets used in many AI applications. Most AI tools are either ineffective in the Indian context or heavily biassed towards a particular perception. I created the following photographs with midjourney as a little fun project over the weekend. I instructed it to create an image of the most stereotypical individual in Indian States. Midjourney AI excels in creating realistic people portraits. It produced some extremely stunning photographs. If you find any of the photos offensive, please understand that this is a result of the underlying datasets, not of midjourney’s or my perspective. I hope you can appreciate the technology and, if you still feel compelled to act, create more representative data on India and its people, by clicking and drawing pictures, writing etc.\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\n\n\nArunachal Pradesh\n\n\n\nAssam\n\n\n\nBihar\n\n\n\nChhattisgarh\n\n\n\nGoa\n\n\n\nGujarat\n\n\n\nHaryana\n\n\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\n\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n\n\nJharkhand\n\n\n\nKarnataka\n\n\n\nKerala\n\n\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\n\n\nMaharashtra\n\n\n\nManipur\n\n\n\nMeghalaya\n\n\n\nMizoram\n\n\n\nNagaland\n\n\n\nNCT of Delhi\n\n\n\nOdisha\n\n\n\nPunjab\n\n\n\nRajasthan\n\n\n\nSikkim\n\n\n\nTamil Nadu\n\n\n\nTelangana\n\n\n\nTripura\n\n\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\n\n\nUttarakhand\n\n\n\nWest Bengal"

    "text": "हम डेटा वैज्ञानिक हैं - अर्थात, हमारा काम यह समझना है कि हम डेटा का विश्लेषण और व्याख्या कैसे करें। जब हम Covid-19 के डेटा का विश्लेषण करते हैं, तो हम बहुत चिंतित होते हैं। समाज के सबसे कमजोर हिस्सों, बुजुर्गों और गरीबों को सबसे अधिक खतरा है, लेकिन बीमारी के प्रसार और प्रभाव को नियंत्रित करने के लिए हम सभी को अपने व्यवहार को बदलने की आवश्यकता है। अपने हाथों को अच्छी तरह से और नियमित रूप से धोएं, समूहों और भीड़ से बचें, कार्यक्रमों को रद्द करें, और अपना चेहरा न छुएं। इस लेख में, हम बताते हैं कि हम क्यों चिंतित हैं, और आपको भी क्यों चिंतित होना चाहिए। आपको जो महत्वपूर्ण जानकारी जानने की आवश्यकता है, उसके एक उत्कृष्ट सारांश के लिए, ईथन एले (एक गैर-लाभकारी संस्था के अध्यक्ष जो महामारियों से जोखिम को कम करने के लिए प्रौद्योगिकियों का विकास करते है) द्वारा लिखित Corona in Brief पढ़ें।\n\n\nहमें एक सुचारू चिकित्सा प्रणाली की आवश्यकता है\nअभी 2 वर्ष पहले हममें से एक (रेचल) को मस्तिष्क में संक्रमण हुआ था, जिसके एक चौथाई मरीज़ो की मृत्यु हो जाती है, और एक तिहाई मरीज़ो को स्थायी संज्ञानात्मक क्षति पहुँचती है। कई अन्य लोगों की दृष्टि और श्रवण-शक्ति स्थायी रूप से नष्ट हो जाती है। अस्पताल की पार्किंग में पहुँचने तक ही रेचल बेसुध सी हो जाती। रेचल भाग्यशाली रही की उसे तुरंत देखभाल, निदान और उपचार प्राप्त हुआ। इस घटना से कुछ समय पहले तक रेचल काफी स्वस्थ थी। आपातकालीन कक्ष तुरंत मिल पाने के कारण ही शायद उसकी जान बच पायी।\nअब ज़रा Covid-19 के बारे में बात करते हैं, और आने वाले हफ्तों और महीनों में रेचल जैसी स्थिति में लोगों के साथ क्या हो सकता है। Covid-19 से संक्रमित पाए जाने वाले लोगों की संख्या हर 3 से 6 दिनों में दोगुनी हो जाती है। तीन दिनों में दोगुनी दर, इसका अर्थ यह है कि संक्रमित पाए जाने वाले लोगों की संख्या तीन सप्ताह में 100 गुना तक बढ़ सकती है (यह वास्तव में इतना सरल नहीं है, लेकिन तकनीकी विवरणों से भटकने से बचते हैं)। 10 संक्रमित लोगों में से एक को कई हफ्तों तक अस्पताल में भर्ती रहने की आवश्यकता होती है, और इनमें से अधिकांश को ऑक्सीजन की भी आवश्यकता होती है। हालांकि इस वायरस के अभी बहुत शुरुआती दिन हैं, अभी से ही ऐसे क्षेत्र हैं जहां अस्पताल पूरी तरह से खत्म हो चुके हैं, और लोग अब उस उपचार को प्राप्त करने में सक्षम नहीं हैं जिनकी उन्हें आवश्यकता है (न केवल Covid-19 के लिए, बल्कि किसी और चीज के लिए भी, जैसे कि रेचल की जरूरत की जीवन रक्षक देखभाल)। उदाहरण के लिए, इटली में, जहां सिर्फ एक हफ्ते पहले अधिकारी कह रहे थे कि सब कुछ ठीक है, अब सोलह मिलियन लोगों को लॉक-डाउन पर रखा गया है (अपडेट: इसे पोस्ट करने के 6 घंटे बाद, इटली ने पूरे देश को लॉक-डाउन में डाल दिया), और इस तरह के तम्बू मरीजों की आमद को संभालने में मदद के लिए लगाए जा रहे हैं:\n\nडॉ एंटोनियो पेसेन्ती, इटली के एक अत्यंत-प्रभावित क्षेत्र में क्षेत्रीय संकट पजवाबी कार्यवाही इकाई के प्रमुख ने कहा है, “अब हम कॉरिडोर में गहन देखभाल उपचार स्थापित करने के लिए मजबूर हो रहे हैं, ऑपरेटिंग थिएटरों में, रिकवरी रूम में … दुनिया की एक सबसे अच्छी स्वास्थ्य प्रणाली, लोम्बार्डी में पतन से एक कदम दूर है।” ### यह फ्लू जैसा नहीं है फ्लू से संक्रमित लोगों की मृत्यु दर लगभग 0.1% है। हार्वर्ड में सेंटर फॉर कम्युनिकेबल डिजीज डायनेमिक्स के निदेशक मार्क लिप्सिच का अनुमान है कि Covid-19 के लिए यह दर 1-2% है। नवीनतम महामारी विज्ञान प्रतिरूपण ने फरवरी में चीन में इस दर को 1.6% पाया, जो कि फ्लू की तुलना में सोलह गुना अधिक है (हालांकि यह काफी अनुदार संख्या हो सकती है, क्योंकि जब चिकिस्ता प्रणाली हालात का सामना नहीं कर पाती तब यह दर तेज़ी से बढ़ती है)। वर्तमान के सबसे अच्छे अनुमानों की उम्मीद है कि Covid-19 इस साल फ्लू की तुलना में इस साल 10 गुना अधिक लोगों की मृत्यु का कारण बनेगा (और एयरबीएनबी में डेटा विज्ञान के पूर्व निदेशक, एलेना ग्रेवाल का प्रतिरूपण दर्शाता है कि यह सबसे खराब स्थिति में 100 गुना अधिक हो सकता है)। यह चिकित्सा प्रणाली पर भारी प्रभाव को नज़रअंदांज़ करते हुए है, जैसे कि ऊपर वर्णित है। ज़ाहिर है कि कुछ लोग खुद को समझाने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं कि यह कोई नई बात नहीं है, फ्लू जैसी बीमारी है, क्योंकि वास्तविकता को स्वीकार करना अत्यंत कठिन है और ये हालात काफी असामान्य हैं।\nहमारे मस्तिष्क की संरचना इस तरह की नहीं है कि हम घातांकीय रूप से बढ़ने वाली इस संक्रमित लोगों की संख्या को सहज रूप से समझ सकें। इसलिए हमें वैज्ञानिकों के रूप में इसका विश्लेषण करना होगा, न कि अपने सहज-ज्ञान का उपयोग करना होगा।\n\nप्रत्येक व्यक्ति जिसे फ्लू है, औसतन, वह 1.3 अन्य लोगों को संक्रमित करता है। जिसे फ्लू के लिए “R0” कहा जाता है। यदि R0 1.0 से कम है, तो संक्रमण फैलना बंद हो जाता है और मर जाता है। यदि यह 1.0 से अधिक है, तो यह फैलता है। वर्तमान में चीन के बाहर Covid-19 के लिए R0 2-3 है। अंतर सुनने में छोटा लग सकता है, लेकिन संक्रमित लोगों की 20 “पीढ़ियां” जब संक्रमण आगे बढ़ाती हैं, 1.3 के R0 का परिणाम 146 संक्रमण होगा, लेकिन 2.5 के R0 का परिणाम होगा 3.6 करोड़! (यह निश्चित रूप से अधूरा है और कई वास्तविक दुनिया के प्रभावों को नजरअंदाज करता है, लेकिन यह Covid-19 और फ़्लू के बीच सापेक्ष अंतर का एक उचित चित्रण है, अन्य सभी तथ्यों को समान मानते हुए)।\nध्यान दें कि R0 किसी बीमारी का एक मौलिक लक्षण नहीं है। यह जवाबी कार्यवाही पर बहुत निर्भर करता है, और यह समय अनुसार बदल सकता है। अतिविशेष रूप से, चीन में Covid-19 के लिए R0 में काफी कमी आई है, और अब यह 1.0 आ रहा है! आप पूछेंगे, कैसे? ऐसे बड़े पैमानों पर कदम उठाना जिनकी अमेरिका जैसे देश में कल्पना करना भी मुश्किल है- उदाहरण के लिए, कई विशाल शहरों को पूरी तरह से बंद कर देना, और एक परीक्षण प्रक्रिया विकसित करना जो एक सप्ताह में दस लाख से अधिक लोगों का परीक्षण मुमकिन बनाता है।\nएक चीज जो सोशल मीडिया पर बहुत अधिक उभरती है (एलोन मस्क जैसे अत्यधिक फ़ॉलो किए गए खातों से भी) कि लोगों में लॉजिस्टिक और घातीय वृद्धि के बीच अंतर की गलतफहमी है। “लॉजिस्टिक” वृद्धि महामारी के “s-आकार” विकास के स्वरुप को संदर्भित करता है। यकीनन घातीय वृद्धि हमेशा के लिए नहीं हो सकती, क्योंकि अन्यथा दुनिया में लोगों की संख्या से अधिक संख्या संक्रमित लोगों की हो जाएगी! इसलिए, अंत में, संक्रमण दर हमेशा कम होनी चाहिए, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप समय के साथ एक s-आकार (जो सिग्मॉइड के रूप में जाना जाता है) की वृद्धि दर बनती है। हालाँकि, घटती वृद्धि दर केवल एक कारण से होती है-यह कोई जादू नहीं है। मुख्य कारण हैं:\n\nबड़े पैमाने पर और प्रभावी सामुदायिक जवाबी कार्यवाही, या\nइतने बड़े प्रतिशत में लोग संक्रमित हैं कि फैलने के लिए कम असंक्रमित लोग बचे हैं।\n\nइसलिए, महामारी के “नियंत्रण” के लिए लॉजिस्टिक वृद्धि के स्वरुप पर निर्भर होने में कोई तार्किक समझदारी नहीं है।\nएक और बात जो आपके स्थानीय समुदाय में Covid-19 के प्रभाव को सहज रूप से समझना कठिन बना देती है, वह यह है कि संक्रमण और अस्पताल में भर्ती होने के बीच बहुत महत्वपूर्ण देरी होती है - आम तौर पर लगभग 11 दिन। यह शायद एक लम्बा समय न प्रतीत हो, लेकिन जब आप इसकी तुलना तब तक संक्रमित लोगों की संख्या से करते हैं, तो इसका मतलब है कि जब तक आप ध्यान देंगे कि अस्पताल में बिस्तर भर चुके हैं, तब तक सामुदायिक संक्रमण इस स्तर पर पहुंच जायेगा कि निपटने के लिए 5-10 गुना अधिक लोग होंगे।\nध्यान दें कि कुछ शुरुआती संकेत ऐसे भी हैं कि आपके स्थानीय क्षेत्र में प्रभाव कम से कम कुछ हद तक जलवायु पर निर्भर हो सकता है। Covid-19 के संभावित प्रसार और मौसम-तत्व के पूर्वानुमान के लिए तापमान और अक्षांश विश्लेषण बताता है कि यह बीमारी अब तक सुहावने जलवायु में फैल रही है (दुर्भाग्य से हमारे लिए, सैन फ्रांसिस्को में तापमान सीमा, जहां हम रहते हैं, उस सीमा के लिए सही है; यह लंदन सहित यूरोप के मुख्य जनसंख्या केंद्रों को भी शामिल करता है।)\n\n\n“घबराएँ नहीं। शान्ति बनाये रखें।” यह मददगार नहीं है\nएक आम प्रतिक्रिया जो हमने सोशल मीडिया पर उन लोगों के लिए देखी है जो चिंतित होने के कारणों की ओर इशारा कर रहे हैं, “घबराओ मत” या “शांत रहो”। कम से कम कहने में तो यह मददगार नहीं है। कोई यह नहीं कह रहा है कि आतंकित होना एक उपयुक्त प्रतिक्रिया है। किसी कारणवष, हालांकि, “शांत रहें” कुछ मंडलियों में बहुत लोकप्रिय प्रतिक्रिया है (लेकिन महामारी विज्ञानियों के बीच नहीं, जिनका काम इन चीजों पर नज़र रखना करना है)। शायद “शांत रहें” कुछ लोगों को अपनी निष्क्रियता के बारे में बेहतर महसूस करने में मदद करता है, या उन्हें ऐसे लोगों से बेहतर महसूस कराता है जिनकी वे कल्पना करते हैं कि वे बिना सिर की मुर्गी की तरह इधर-उधर भाग रहे हैं।\nलेकिन “शांत रहें” काफी आसानी से आपकी तैयारी और जवाबी कार्यवाही की विफलता का कारण बन सकता है। चीन में, दसियों लाख को लॉक-डाउन पर रखा गया था और दो नए अस्पतालों का निर्माण उस समय तक कर लिया गया था जब उनकी स्तिथि वैसी थी जैसी अमेरिका की अब है। इटली ने बहुत लंबा इंतजार किया, और आज (रविवार 8 मार्च को) उन्होंने 1692 लोगों को बंद करने के बावजूद 1492 नए मामले और 133 नई मौतें दर्ज कीं। इस समय सबसे अच्छी जानकारी के आधार पर हम यह पता लगा सकते हैं कि 2-3 सप्ताह पहले इटली भी उसी स्थिति में था,जो अमेरिका और ब्रिटेन में आज (संक्रमण के आंकड़ों के संदर्भ में) है।\nध्यान दें कि इस समय पर Covid-19 के बारे में लगभग सब कुछ हवा में है। हम वास्तव में इसकी संक्रमण की गति या मृत्यु दर नहीं जानते हैं, हम यह नहीं जानते हैं कि यह सतहों पर कितनी देर तक सक्रिय रहता है, हम नहीं जानते कि यह गर्म परिस्थितियों में जीवित रह सकता है, फैल सकता है या नहीं। हमारे पास जो कुछ भी है वो इस समय तक लोगों द्वारा जुटाई गयी जानकारियों के आधार पर हमारे सर्वोत्तम अनुमान हैं। और याद रखें, इस जानकारी का अधिकांश हिस्सा चीन में, चीनी में है। वर्तमान में, चीन के अनुभव को समझने का सबसे अच्छा तरीका है कि चीन, जर्मनी, जापान, कोरिया, नाइजीरिया, रूस, सिंगापुर, अमेरिका और विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन (WHO) के 25 राष्ट्रीय और अंतर्राष्ट्रीय विशेषज्ञों के संयुक्त मिशन के आधार पर, WHO-चीन संयुक्त मिशन की उत्कृष्ट रिपोर्ट को कोरोनावायरस रोग 2019 पर पढ़ें।\nजब यह अनिश्चित है कि, यह वैश्विक महामारी बनेगा या नहीं, और शायद सब कुछ बस ठीक से गुज़र जाये बिना अस्पताल तंत्र के ढहे हुए, तब इसका अर्थ ये बिलकुल नहीं है कि कुछ न करना ही उचित जवाबी कार्यवाही है। यह जूए के समान होगा और किसी भी खतरे के प्रतिरूप के परिदृश्य में यह हमारी ईष्टतम प्रतिक्रिया नहीं होगी। यह भी काफी असंभव सा है कि इटली और चीन जैसे देश बिना किसी अच्छे कारण के अपनी अर्थव्यवस्था के बड़े हिस्से को प्रभावी ढंग से बंद कर देंगे। यह उन वास्तविक प्रभावों के साथ भी तर्कसंगत नहीं है जो हम संक्रमित क्षेत्रों में जमीन पर देख रहे हैं, जहां चिकित्सा प्रणाली सामना करने में असमर्थ है (उदाहरण के लिए, इटली “प्री-ट्राइएज” के लिए 462 टेंट का उपयोग कर रहा है, और अभी भी आईसीयू रोगियों को स्थानांतरित करना है संक्रमित क्षेत्रों से)।\nइसके बजाय, विचारशील, उचित प्रतिक्रिया उन चरणों का पालन करना है जो विशेषज्ञों द्वारा संक्रमण फैलाने से बचने के लिए अनुशंसित हैं:\n\nबड़े समूहों और भीड़ से बचें\nकार्यक्रमों को रद्द करें\nयदि संभव हो तो घर से काम करें\nघर से आते और जाते समय और बाहर आने पर बार-बार हाथ धोएं\nअपने चेहरे को छूने से बचें, खासकर जब आपके घर के बाहर (आसान नहीं!)\nसतहों और सामान को कीटाणु रहित करें (यह संभव है कि वायरस सतहों पर 9 दिनों तक सक्रिय रह सकता है, हालांकि यह अभी भी निश्चित रूप से ज्ञात नहीं है)।\n\n\n\nयह केवल आपके बारे में नहीं है\nयदि आप 50 वर्ष से कम उम्र के हैं, और जोखिम कारक नहीं हैं, जैसे कि कमज़ोर प्रतिरक्षा प्रणाली, हृदय रोग, धूम्रपान का इतिहास, या अन्य पुरानी बीमारियां, तो आपको कुछ आराम हो सकता है कि Covid-19 की आपको मारने की संभावना बहुत कम है। लेकिन इसके प्रति आपकी प्रतिकिरिया अभी भी बहुत मायने रखती है। आपके पास अभी भी संक्रमित होने की अधिक संभावना है, और यदि होते हैं, तो बस दूसरों को संक्रमित करने की भी उतनी ही सम्भावना है। औसतन, प्रत्येक संक्रमित व्यक्ति दो से अधिक लोगों को संक्रमित कर रहा है, और वे लक्षण दिखाने से पहले संक्रामक हो जाते हैं। यदि आपके पास ऐसे माता-पिता हैं जिनकी आप परवाह करते हैं, या दादा-दादी, और उनके साथ समय बिताने की योजना बनाते हैं, और बाद में पता चलता है कि आप उन्हें Covid-19 के साथ संक्रमित करने के लिए जिम्मेदार हैं, तो आपको इस बोझ के साथ जीना पड़ेगा।\nयहां तक कि अगर आप 50 से अधिक की उम्र के लोगों के संपर्क में नहीं हैं, तो यह संभावना है कि आपके पास ऐसे सहकर्मी और परिचित हैं जिनकी गंभीर बीमारियों का आपको अनुमान भी नहीं है। अनुसंधान से पता चलता है कि कुछ लोग कार्यस्थल में अपने स्वास्थ्य की स्थिति का खुलासा करने से बचते हैं, यदि वो बच सकते हैं, क्योंकि उन्हें भेदभाव का डर होता है। हम दोनों ही उच्च जोखिम की श्रेणियों में हैं, लेकिन कई लोग जिनसे हम नियमित रूप से बातचीत करते हैं, वे शायद यह नहीं जानते होंगे।\nऔर हाँ, यह केवल आपके आस पास के लोगो की बात नहीं है। यह एक अत्यधिक महत्वपूर्ण नैतिक मुद्दा है। प्रत्येक व्यक्ति जो वायरस के प्रसार को नियंत्रित करने में योगदान करने की पूरी कोशिश करता है, वह संक्रमण की दर को धीमा करने में अपने पूरे समुदाय की मदद कर रहा है। जैसा कि ज़ीनेप तुफैकी ने साइंटिफिक अमेरिकन में लिखा है: “इस वायरस के लगभग अवश्यंभावी वैश्विक प्रसार के लिए तैयारी … समाज के लिए सबसे अधिक परोपकारी चीजों में से एक है जो आप कर सकते हैं”। वह लिखती हैं:\n\nहमें तैयार होना चाहिए, इसलिए नहीं कि हम व्यक्तिगत रूप से जोखिम महसूस कर सकते हैं, बल्कि इसलिए ताकि हम सभी के लिए जोखिम कम करने में मदद कर सकें। हमें तैयार नहीं होना चाहिए क्योंकि हम अपने नियंत्रण से बाहर एक कयामत के दिन का सामना कर रहे हैं, लेकिन क्योंकि हम इस जोखिम के हर पहलू को बदल सकते हैं जो हम एक समाज के रूप में सामना करते हैं। यह सही है, आपको तैयार रहना चाहिए क्योंकि आपके पड़ोसियों को आपको तैयार करने की आवश्यकता है - विशेष रूप से आपके बुजुर्ग पड़ोसी, आपके पड़ोसी जो अस्पतालों में काम करते हैं, आपके पड़ोसी पुरानी बीमारियों के साथ, और आपके पड़ोसी जिनके पास साधन या समय नहीं हैं तैयारी का जिसका कारण संसाधनों की कमी हो या समय की।\n\nइसने हमें व्यक्तिगत रूप से प्रभावित किया है। हमारा सबसे बड़ा और सबसे महत्वपूर्ण कोर्स फ़ास्ट.एआई, जो हमारे लिए वर्षों के काम की परिणति का प्रतिनिधित्व करता है, एक सप्ताह में सैन फ्रांसिस्को विश्वविद्यालय में शुरू होने वाला था। पिछले बुधवार (4 मार्च) को, हमने पूरी बात ऑनलाइन स्थानांतरित करने का निर्णय लिया। हम ऑनलाइन स्थानांतरित करने वाले पहले बड़े पाठ्यक्रमों में से एक थे। हमने ऐसा क्यों किया? क्योंकि हमें पिछले हफ्ते की शुरुआत में एहसास हुआ कि अगर हम इस कोर्स को चलाते हैं, तो हम अनुमानित रूप से सैकड़ों लोगों को एक संलग्न स्थान पर एक साथ आने के लिए प्रोत्साहित कर रहे थे, कई बार एक बहु-सप्ताह की अवधि में। संलग्न स्थानों में समूहों को एक साथ लाना सबसे खराब काम है जो इस समय किया जा सकता है। हमने यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए नैतिक रूप से बाध्य महसूस किया कि कम से कम इस मामले में, यह नहीं हुआ। यह दिल तोड़ने वाला फैसला था। हमारे छात्रों के साथ सीधे काम करने में हमारा समय हर साल महान सुखों और सबसे अधिक उत्पादक अवधियों में से एक रहा है। और हमारे पास छात्रों को दुनिया भर से उड़ान भरने की योजना थी, जिन्हें हम वास्तव में निराश नहीं करना चाहते थे।\nलेकिन हमें पता था कि यह करना सही है, क्योंकि अन्यथा हम अपने समुदाय में बीमारी के प्रसार को बढ़ा सकते हैं।\n\n\nहमें वक्र को समतल करने की आवश्यकता है\nयह अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण है, क्योंकि अगर हम किसी समुदाय में संक्रमण की दर को धीमा कर सकते हैं, तो हम उस समुदाय के अस्पतालों को दोनों, संक्रमित रोगियों से निपटने में, और नियमित रोगी भार में साथ देते हैं जिसे उन्हें संभालने की आवश्यकता है। इसे “वक्र को समतल करना” के रूप में वर्णित किया गया है, और इस चित्रमय मानचित्र में स्पष्ट रूप से दिखाया गया है:\n\nहेल्थ आईटी के पूर्व नेशनल कोऑर्डिनेटर फ़रज़ाद मोस्तश्री ने स्पष्ट किया: “हर दिन नए मामलों की पहचान की जा रही है, जिनका यात्रा इतिहास या किसी ज्ञात मामले से कोई संबंध नहीं है, और हम जानते हैं कि ये सिर्फ बड़ी समस्या की एक छोटी सी झलक है जिसका कारण है परिक्षण में हो रही देरी। इसका मतलब है कि अगले दो हफ्तों में निदान किए गए मामलों की संख्या में विस्फोट होगा … जब समुदाय में घातांकीय रूप से फैलाव हो रहा हो तब उसकी रोकथाम की कोशिश करना इस प्रकार है जैसे जलते हुए घर में चिंगारियों पर ध्यान लगाना। जब ऐसा होता है, तो हमें शमन करने के लिए रणनीतियों को बदलने की आवश्यकता होती है - स्वास्थ्य देखभाल पर चरम प्रभाव को कम करना और कम करने के लिए सुरक्षात्मक उपाय करना।” यदि हम बीमारी के फैलाव को कम रख सकते हैं कि हमारे अस्पताल भार को संभाल सकें, तो लोग उपचार तक पहुंच सकते हैं। लेकिन अगर मामले बहुत जल्दी आते हैं, तो ज़रूरतमंदो को अस्पताल में भर्ती होने नहीं मिलेगा।\nलिज़ स्पैट के अनुसार यहां गणित कुछ ऐसा दिख सकता है:\n\nअमेरिका में प्रति 1000 लोगों पर लगभग 2.8 अस्पताल बेड हैं। 330M की आबादी के साथ, यह ~ 1M बेड है। किसी भी समय, उन बिस्तरों में से 65% पर पहले से ही कब्जा होता है। यह देश भर में उपलब्ध 330k बिस्तरों को छोड़ता है (शायद नियमित फ्लू के मौसम के कारण ये आँकड़ा इस समय थोड़ा कम होगा)। आइए इटली की संख्या पर निर्भर हो कर मान लें कि लगभग 10% मामले अस्पताल में भर्ती होने के लिए गंभीर हैं। (ध्यान रखें कि कई रोगियों को अस्पताल में हफ्तों तक रहना पड़ता है - दूसरे शब्दों में, यह प्रक्रिया बहुत धीमी होगी क्योंकि बिस्तर COVID19 रोगियों से भर जायेंगे)। इस अनुमान के अनुसार, 8 मई तक, अमेरिका में सभी खुले अस्पताल बेड भर जाएंगे। (ये यह बिलकुल नहीं बताता है कि यह बिस्तर अत्यधिक संक्रामक रोगो के अलगाव के लिए उपयुक्त होंगे या नहीं।) अगर हम गंभीर मामलों के अंश के बारे में दो घटक से ग़लत हैं, तो यह अस्पताल में बिस्तरों के ख़त्म होने की समयरेखा को मात्र 6 दिन से बदलता है जो किसी भी दिशा में हो सकता है। यदि 20% मामलों में अस्पताल में भर्ती होने की आवश्यकता होती है, तो बिस्तरों की ख़त्म होने की तारीख होगी ~ 2 मई, यदि केवल 5% मामलों में ही इसकी आवश्यकता होती है, तो हम इसे ~ 14 मई तक चला पाएंगे। 2.5% हमें 20 मई तक ले जायेगा। यह गणना बिलकुल ये मान के की गयी है कि गैर-Covid19 मामलो से बिस्तरों की मांग में कोई उतार चढ़ाव नहीं होगा, जो कि काफी संशयात्मक प्रतीत होता है। जैसे-जैसे स्वास्थ्य सेवा प्रणाली तेजी से बोझिल होती जा रही है, Rx की कमी इत्यादि बढ़ती जा रही है, गंभीर रोगों से जूझते लोगों की चिकित्सा जो सामान्य रूप से अच्छी तरह से प्रबंधित होती हैं, वह चिकित्सा संकट की स्तिथि में बदल सकती है जिसमें ऐसे लोगों को गहन देखभाल और अस्पताल भर्ती की ज़रूरत होगी।\n\n\n\nसमाज की जवाबी कार्यवाही से ही सारा अंतर पड़ता है\nजैसा कि हमने चर्चा की है, यह गणित निश्चित नहीं है - चीन पहले ही दिखा चुका है कि ठोस कदम उठाकर प्रसार को कम करना संभव है। एक सफल जवाबी कार्यवाही का एक और शानदार उदाहरण वियतनाम है, जहां अन्य बातों के अलावा, एक राष्ट्रव्यापी विज्ञापन अभियान (एक आकर्षक गीत सहित) ने तेजी से समाज को उचित जवाबी कार्यवाही के लिए एकजुट किया और यह सुनिश्चित किया कि लोग अपने व्यवहार को उचित रूप से समायोजित करें।\nयह केवल एक काल्पनिक स्थिति नहीं है - यह 1918 फ्लू महामारी में स्पष्ट रूप से प्रदर्शित किया गया था। अमेरिका में दो शहरों ने महामारी के लिए बहुत अलग जवाबी कार्यवाही प्रदर्शित कीं: फिलाडेल्फिया में 200,000 लोगों की विशाल परेड का आयोजन किया गया ताकि युद्ध के लिए पैसे जुटा सकें। लेकिन सेंट लुइस ने बड़े संपर्कों को रद्द करने के साथ-साथ वायरस के प्रसार को कम करने के लिए सामाजिक संपर्कों को कम करने के लिए सावधानीपूर्वक तैयार की। यहाँ प्रत्येक शहर में मौतों की संख्या कितनी है, यह नेशनल एकेडमी ऑफ साइंसेज की कार्यवाही में दिखाया गया है:\n\nफिलाडेल्फिया में स्थिति बेहद गंभीर हो गई, यहां तक कि एक समय पर ऐसे स्थान भी थे जहां फ्लू से मृतकों की भारी संख्या को संभालने के लिए पर्याप्त ताबूत या मुर्दाघर नहीं थे।\nरिचर्ड बेस्सर, जो कि रोग नियंत्रण और रोकथाम केंद्रों के कार्यवाहक निदेशक थे 2019 H1N1 महामारी के समय, ने कहा है कि अमेरिका में “रोग के जोखिम से बचने की और अपने परिवार को बचाने की क्षमता निर्भर करती है, आय पर, स्वस्थ्य देखभाल तक पहुँच पर, और आव्रजन स्तिथि पर, और भी अन्य कारणों के साथ”, वे बताते हैं:\n\nबुजुर्गों और विकलांगों को विशेष जोखिम होता है जब उनके दैनिक जीवन और समर्थन प्रणाली बाधित होती है। ग्रामीण और मूल निवासी समुदायों सहित स्वास्थ्य देखभाल की आसान पहुंच के बिना, जरूरत के समय कठिन दूरी का सामना करना पड़ सकता है। पास के क्वार्टर में रहने वाले लोग - चाहे सार्वजनिक आवास, नर्सिंग होम, जेल, आश्रय या यहां तक कि सड़कों पर बेघर - लहरों में पीड़ित हो सकते हैं, जैसा कि हम पहले ही वाशिंगटन राज्य में देख चुके हैं। और कम वेतन वाले गिग इकॉनमी की कमजोरियां, गैर-वेतनभोगी श्रमिकों और अनिश्चित काम की सारणी, इस संकट के दौरान सभी के सामने उजागर हो जाएगी। 60 प्रतिशत अमेरिकी श्रम शक्ति से पूछें जो प्रति घंटा वेतन उन्हें मिलता है उससे ज़रूरत के समय छुट्टी लेना कितना आसान है।\n\nयूएस ब्यूरो ऑफ लेबर स्टैटिस्टिक्स से पता चलता है कि सबसे कम आय वाले बैंड में एक तिहाई से भी कम लोगों को भुगतान के साथ बीमारी के लिए अवकाश मिलता है:\n\n\n\nअमेरिका में हमारे पास पर्याप्त जानकारी नहीं है\nयूएस में एक बड़ा मुद्दा यह है कि बहुत कम परीक्षण किया जा रहा है, और परीक्षण के परिणाम ठीक से साझा नहीं किए जा रहे हैं, जिसका अर्थ है कि हम नहीं जानते कि वास्तव में क्या हो रहा है। पिछले FDA कमिश्नर स्कॉट गोटलिब ने बताया कि सिएटल में बेहतर परीक्षण किया गया है, और हम वहाँ संक्रमण देख रहे हैं: “स्वतंत्र वैज्ञानिको के प्रहरी निगरानी कार्य के कारण हम सीएटल में के प्रकोप के बारे में जल्दी जान पाए हैं। अन्य शहरों में ऐसी निगरानी पूरी तरह से कभी नहीं हुई। अन्य अमेरिकी अतिप्रभावित क्षेत्रों का अभी तक पूरी तरह से पता नहीं लगाया जा सकता है। द अटलांटिक के अनुसार, उपराष्ट्रपति माइक पेंस ने वादा किया कि इस सप्ताह”लगभग 1.5 मिलियन परीक्षण” उपलब्ध होंगे, लेकिन इस समय तक पूरे अमेरिका में 2,000 से कम लोगों का परीक्षण किया गया है। COVID ट्रैकिंग प्रोजेक्ट पर आधारित, द अटलांटिक के रॉबिन्सन मेयर और एलेक्सिस मेड्रिगल, ने कहा:\n\nहमने जो आंकड़े इकट्ठे किए हैं, उनका सुझाव है कि Covid-19 और इससे होने वाली बीमारी, COVID-19, के प्रति अमेरिकी जवाबी कार्यवाही विशेष रूप से अन्य विकसित देशों के साथ तुलनात्मक रूप से सुस्त रही है। सीडीसी ने आठ दिन पहले पुष्टि की थी कि वायरस संयुक्त राज्य में सामुदायिक संचरण में था - यह उन अमेरिकियों को संक्रमित कर रहा था, जो न तो विदेश यात्रा पर थे और न ही उन लोगों के संपर्क में थे। दक्षिण कोरिया में, सामुदायिक प्रसारण के पहले मामले के एक सप्ताह के भीतर 66,650 से अधिक लोगों का परीक्षण किया गया था, और वह जल्दी से एक दिन में 10,000 लोगों का परीक्षण करने में सक्षम हो गया।\n\nसमस्या का हिस्सा यह है कि यह एक राजनीतिक मुद्दा बन गया है। विशेष रूप से, राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प ने यह स्पष्ट कर दिया है कि वह “संख्या” (जो कि अमेरिका में संक्रमित लोगों की संख्या है) को कम रखना चाहते हैं। यह एक उदाहरण है, जहां अनुकूलन मेट्रिक्स असल में अच्छे परिणाम प्राप्त करने में हस्तक्षेप करता है। (इस मुद्दे पर अधिक जानकारी के लिए, डेटा विज्ञान की नैतिकता पेपर देखें मैट्रिक्स की समस्या एआई के लिए एक मौलिक समस्या है)। Google के AI के प्रमुख जेफ डीन ने ट्वीट कर राजनीतिक विघटन की समस्याओं के बारे में अपनी चिंता व्यक्त की:\n\nजब मैंने WHO में काम किया, तो मैं AIDS (अब UNAIDS) पर वैश्विक कार्यक्रम का हिस्सा था, जो दुनिया को HIV/AIDS महामारी से निपटने में मदद करने के लिए बनाया गया था। वहां के कर्मचारी समर्पित डॉक्टर थे और वैज्ञानिकों ने उस संकट के समाधान में मदद करने के लिए तीव्रता से ध्यान केंद्रित किया। संकट के समय में, स्पष्ट और सटीक जानकारी सभी को उचित और सूचित निर्णय लेने में मदद करने के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है (देश, राज्य और स्थानीय सरकारें, कंपनियां, गैर सरकारी संगठन, स्कूल, परिवार और व्यक्ति)। सर्वोत्तम चिकित्सा और वैज्ञानिक विशेषज्ञों को सुनने के लिए सही जानकारी और नीतियों के साथ, हम सभी HIV/AIDS या Covid-19 द्वारा प्रस्तुत की गई चुनौतियों से पार पाएंगे। राजनीतिक हितों से प्रेरित दुष्प्रचार का वास्तविक जोखिम यह है की हम जल्दी काय्रवाही न कर के हालातों को बद से बत्तर बनाएंगे और यह सुनिश्चि करेंगे के महामारी से झूझते हुए हम ऐसे व्यहवार को बढ़ावा दे बैठे जिससे कि रोग और फैले। ऐसी स्तिथि को बनते हुए देखना बेहद दर्दनाक है।\n\nऐसा लगता तो नहीं है के पारदर्शिता के सन्दर्भ में हालत को बदलने की राजनीतिक इच्छाशक्ति यहां है। वायर्ड के अनुसार, स्वास्थ्य और मानव सेवा सचिव एलेक्स अजार ने कहा, “उन परीक्षणों के बारे में बात करना शुरू कर दिया जो स्वास्थ्य देखभाल कार्यकर्ता यह निर्धारित करने के लिए उपयोग करते हैं कि कोई नए कोरोनोवायरस से संक्रमित है या नहीं। उन किटों की कमी का मतलब अमेरिका में बीमारी के प्रसार और गंभीरता के बारे में महामारी विज्ञान संबंधी जानकारी का एक खतरनाक अभाव है, जो सरकार की ओर से अस्पष्टता से बढ़ा है। अज़ार ने यह कहने की कोशिश की कि अधिक परीक्षण किये जायेंगे पर गुणवत्ता नियंत्रण लंबित है।” लेकिन, उन्होंने जारी रखा: &gt; तब ट्रम्प ने अजार की बात काटते हुए कहा “लेकिन मुझे लगता है, महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है, किसी को भी, अभी और कल, यदि परीक्षण की ज़रूरत पड़ी है तो उसका परीक्षण हुआ है। वह हैं, उनके परीक्षण हुए हैं, और परीक्षण बहुत अच्छे हैं। ट्रम्प ने कहा कि जिसे परीक्षण की ज़रूरत है, उसे परीक्षण मिलेगा। यह असत्य है। उपराष्ट्रपति पेंस ने गुरुवार को संवाददाताओं से कहा कि अमेरिका के पास मांग को पूरा करने के लिए पर्याप्त परीक्षण किट नहीं हैं।\nअन्य देश अमेरिका की तुलना में बहुत अधिक तेजी से और महत्वपूर्ण रूप से जवाबी कार्यवाही कर रहे हैं। दक्षिण-पूर्वी एशिया के कई देश ताइवान सहित उत्तम परिणाम दिखा रहे हैं, जहां R0 अभी 0.3 से नीचे है, और सिंगापुर, जिसे द मॉडल फॉर Covid-19 रिस्पांस के रूप में प्रस्तावित किया जा रहा है। यह सिर्फ एशिया में ही नहीं है; उदाहरण के लिए, फ्रांस में, 1000 लोगों से अधिक का इकट्ठा होना मना है, और स्कूल अब तीन जिलों में बंद हैं।\n\n\nनिष्कर्ष\nCovid-19 एक महत्वपूर्ण सामाजिक मुद्दा है, और हमें बीमारी के प्रसार को कम करने के लिए काम करना चाहिए। इसका मतलब है की:\n\nबड़े समूहों और भीड़ से बचना\nकार्यक्रमों को रद्द करना\nघर से काम करना, यदि संभव हो तो\nघर से आते और जाते समय और बाहर आने पर बार-बार हाथ धोएं\nअपने चेहरे को छूने से बचें, खासकर जब आपके घर के बाहर\n\nध्यान दें: इसे छापने की जल्दबाज़ी में, इसमें उपयोग की गयी जानकारियों का हवाला और श्रेय देने में हमने उतनी सावधानी नहीं

    "text": "Data Warehouse Schema Design\nIn trditional data warehousing, we often refer to the Star Schema. This involves creating too many fact tables during ETL processes, with the unit of reusability being a table with some dimensionality. But the truth is, reusability should be about the data itself, not its definition.\n\nThe star schema was designed during a time when the databases were slow and the data was relatively big. Another issue with this approach is the lack of real-time data processing. If you produce an intermittent artifact, it won’t be real time, as these artifacts are produced and then joined later."

    "text": "Dimensional Freedom\nMalloy offers the power of ‘Dimensional Freedom’. This concept allows you to produce results from anywhere in the join network, giving you the flexibility to view your data from different dimensions. The system also deduces a primary key, streamlines it, and formulates the calculation for you.\n\nSource\n\nIn contrast to traditional SQL, Malloy’s reusability lies in a source.\n\nsource: orders_items is table('duckdb:orders.csv') + {\n join_many: items is table('duckdb:order_items.csv')\n on order_id = items.order_id\n declare:\n total_revenue is items.price.sum()\n total_shipping is shipping_cost.sum()\n}\n\nA source can be named, like the above source is named order_items.\nThe sources describe the join relationships, like the above source describes the relationship between orders and order_items\nSources describe both aggregate and scalar calculations.\nSource makes queries incredibly simple. For example, performing an aggregate calculation on the above source looks like this in malloy:\n\nquery: orders_items -&gt; {\n group_by: order_date\n aggregate: total_revenue, total_shipping\n order_by: 1\n}\n\n\n\norder_date\ntotal_revenue\ntotal_shipping\n\n\n\n\n2022-01-01\n6\n5\n\n\n2022-01-02\n5\n3\n\n\n\nIt recognizes that data naturally comes nested, and the need to separate them is an artifact of the SQL engine, not a real-world necessity."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Scaling, in general, is starting out with a small solution and growing it into a bigger solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent people mean different things when they talk about scaling. Do you want to scale a mountain, a web app, or an ML pipeline?\nEven when talking about machine learning, scaling can mean different things:~\n\nProcessing more data\nUsing a more complex model\nRunning more often\n\n\nScaling comes at a cost\nScaling requires resources and cost to execute. The cost can be in the form of:~\n\nDeveloper time required for code refactoring and optimization for performance\nPerformance optimized hardware for accelerated computing\nDistributed processing requires more computers\nLonger wait time for processing more on the same infrastructure\n\n\n\nThink before you scale\nThere are two important things to consider before you invest in scaling:~\n\nWhat are your goals? You must decide beforehand, what is good enough? Over-engineering is a trap, all engineers are familiar with. Don’t over-engineer!\nMeasure your code? To treat a patient, a doctor has to determine what the illness is? Likewise, you need to measure your code for bottlenecks before deciding on a scaling strategy. There are many tools that can use to profile your python code. Scalene is one of the most complete measuring tools available at the moment.\n\n\n\nHow to scale?\n\nIncrease code efficiency: Python is designed for ease of use and easy extension, but not performance. As a developer, the onus is on you to do more work so that the application executes less code. Whenever possible use vectorized library functions instead of loops. Python is successful in data science because of the pre-compiled code offered by data-appropriate libraries in the pydata stack such as pandas and numpy.\nAdding parallelism: You can achieve parallelism on a single machine or by using multiple machines. In principle, you want to stay on a single machine as much as possible as distributed computing increased complexity because of the following challenges:\n\nnetwork transfer\ntask management\ncluster management\n\n2.1 Hardware accelerators: You can leverage GPUs and TPUs for your ML workflows. Libraries such as CuPy and RAPIDS leverage GPUs. There are non-GPU accelerators also like TPUs offered by Google and Apple Neural Engine.\n2.2 Distributed Computing: Going distributed is much harder for the aforementioned reasons but if you have to then you can look at the following projects:\n\nDask: Distributed data frames, machine learning and more\nRay: Parallel python framework\nHorovod: Uber’s framework for distributed deep learning\nPySpark: Python wrapper for Apache Spark ecosystem\n\n\nWhichever direction you take on your scaling journey, be sure to pause before you commit, and solve one problem at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI have not covered I/O scaling in this post. That is a conversation for some other day."
